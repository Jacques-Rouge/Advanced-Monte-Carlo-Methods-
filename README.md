Advanced Monte Carlo Method compared with basic ones 

Monte Carlo methods for SDEs face a high computational cost of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ due to discretization bias. This study implements and compares two superior alternatives: Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) and Unbiased Monte Carlo. Both methods are highly effective, significantly improving efficiency to approximately $O(\epsilon^{-2})$. Numerical tests on terminal and Asian payoffs confirm that both models are robust, showing consistent convergence toward expected values while effectively managing the trade-offs between variance and systematic error.
